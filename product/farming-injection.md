# RUM Injection

{% hint style="info" %}
**WHAT IS RUM ?**

This water and alcohol combination is better known as grog. In addition, one of the most popular alcoholic spirits that pirates regularly consumed was rum. Distilled from fermented molasses, rum was very popular on pirate ships as it was inexpensive to produce. Vikings brewed their own beer, mead, and wine. The Vikings drank strong beer at festive occasions, together with the popular drink of mead. RUM grants the Viking-NESS a limited boost in strength, allowing them to gain more power for their next adventure.

They fell into three categories in ascending order of skill, as well as exposure to Rum:

1. Alpha NULL - 7% of all NESS Alpha Gate Opening powers.
2. Beta NULL - 13% of all Beta NESS Gate Opening powers.
3. Gamma NULL - NESS's most torturous program, Gamma NESS increases which can hone open the final gates of their power leading to death.

> #### Each user starts with 15 RUM and is incremented by 50% every day until the maximum number of RUM is reached \(the number of skills of NESS-Viking is proportional to the number of RUM injected\).
>
> * Alpha: users with the most staked amount -- MAXIMUM RUM INJECTED = 32
> * Beta: user with the smallest staked amount -- MAXIMUM RUM INJECTED = 95
> * Gamma: users with the intermediate staked amount -- MAXIMUM RUM INJECTED = 180
>
> _In addition, the use of NFT cards also helps the user to increase the number of skills faster \(like chronos injection\)._

The number users of three range are depended on the total users as below:

| Total users | Alpha 7% | Beta 13% | Gamma 80% |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0-99 | 0-7 | 8-20 | &gt;20 |
| 100-199 | 0-15 | 15-40 | &gt;40 |
| 200-299 | 0-22 | 22-60 | &gt;60 |
| 300-399 | 0-29 | 29-80 | &gt;80 |
| 400-499 | 0-36 | 36-100 | &gt;100 |
| &gt;500 | 0-43 | 43-120 | &gt;120 |
